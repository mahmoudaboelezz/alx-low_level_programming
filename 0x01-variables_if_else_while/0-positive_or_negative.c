    You can find the source code here
    The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
    You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
    The output of the program should be:
    The number, followed by
    if the number is greater than 0: is positive
    if the number is 0: is zero
    if the number is less than 0: is negative
    followed by a new line
